* sql-snowflake.el
** intro
   This package extends Emacs' built-in =sql= package with support for
   [[https://www.snowflake.com][Snowflake]]. For now it merely wires-up
   =sql-interactive-mode= to
   [[https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/snowsql][SnowSQL]], the official
   CLI client. Contributions (perhaps adding other functionality, such as
   improved font-locking) are welcome.

** installation
*** SnowSQL
    To use the =sql-interactive-mode= support, first
    [[https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/snowsql-install-config][install SnowSQL]].

*** the package itself
    This package is not yet available from MELPA or ELPA. Instead, you may
    install it directly from [[https://github.com/eeshugerman/sql-snowflake.el][the GitHub repo]]. Here's one way to do that:
    #+begin_src emacs-lisp
      (package-vc-install "https://github.com/eeshugerman/sql-snowflake.el")
      (require 'sql-snowflake)
    #+end_src
    Other (more sophisticated) approaches might involve Quelpa or =straight.el=.

** usage
   Configure connections just as for other =sql-interactive-mode= products, eg:
   #+begin_src emacs-lisp
     (add-to-list 'sql-connection-alist
                  '("my snowflake connection"
                    (sql-product 'snowflake)
                    (sql-account "my-account")
                    (sql-server "my-account.snowflakecomputing.com")
                    (sql-user "my-username")
                    (sql-password "my-password")
                    (sql-database "my-initial-database") ;; optional
                    (sql-warehouse "my-initial-warehouse"))) ;; optional
   #+end_src

   Then do `M-x sql-connect` and select `my snowflake connection`.
