* sql-snowflake.el
** intro
   This package extends Emacs' built-in =sql= package with support for [[https://www.snowflake.com][Snowflake]].
   For now it merely wires-up =sql-interactive-mode= to [[https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/snowsql][SnowSQL]], the official CLI
   client. Contributions adding other functionality, such as improved font-locking,
   are encouraged.

** installation
   TODO

** configuration
   Configure connections just as you do for built-in SQL products, eg:
   #+begin_src emacs-lisp
     (add-to-list 'sql-connection-alist
                  '("my snowflake connection"
                    (sql-product 'snowflake)
                    (sql-account "my-account")
                    (sql-server "my-account.snowflakecomputing.com")
                    (sql-user "my-username")
                    (sql-password "my-password")
                    (sql-database "my-initial-database") ;; optional
                    (sql-warehouse "my-initial-warehouse"))) ;; optional
   #+end_src
